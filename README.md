# Market-Basket-Analysis
This project demonstrates Market Basket Analysis using association rule mining techniques such as the Apriori algorithm. The goal is to discover frequent itemsets and association rules from customer transactions in order to understand purchasing behavior and generate product recommendations.




 Project Overview

Objective: Analyze customer purchase history to find relationships between products.

Techniques Used:

Data preprocessing

Association rule mining

Apriori algorithm

Support, Confidence, Lift metrics

Output: A set of frequent item combinations and strong association rules for recommendations.




 Dataset

The dataset (Market_Basket_Data.csv) contains customer transactions.
Each row represents a single transaction, and each column represents a purchased product.



 Results

Discovered frequent product sets.

Generated association rules with support, confidence, and lift values.

Example rule:

> If a customer buys Mobile Phone, they are likely to buy Charger (support: 0.15, confidence: 0.65, lift: 1.8).
